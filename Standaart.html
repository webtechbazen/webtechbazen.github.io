				<h1>Standardisation of HTML</h1>

				<p>In an ideal world HTML would be a strict and static language, no matter when or by whom the HTML is written it will always be the same. In this ideal world every site will look the same on every browser because every browser will interpret every HTML file the same. Sadly this is not the case. As web browser you now have the almost impossible task of extracting meaning out of “HTML” made by utterly incompetent amateurs.</p>

				<h2>Effects of failing standardisation</h2>

				<p>When no one abides the HTML guidelines, browsers are forced to guess what was intended by the author. If they do not show a respectable site the internet user will think it is the fault of the browser and not the author. This leads to the strange situation that every browser shows a different solution. When Internet Explorer was the market leader this was not a big problem, amateurs just wrote HTML and tested it on Internet Explorer and if it looked the way they intended it they were happy. They then put there site online and everybody only visited the site via Internet Explorer so every body was happy. When other browser became popular and started implementing there own ‘bad HTML interpret’ solutions, a badly written site looked different on every browser.</p>

				<h2>Solutions</h2>

				<p>Bla bla … two solutions. The first was introducing a more strict rules on the author side, so there was no space for error. If a HTML file did not abide the rules the browser would just give an error message for example. This would result in a more standardised web but it makes it more difficult to write HTML for the average hobbyist. The other solution was more strict rules on the browser side. So if there is a mistake in the HTML (like, <b> some text <i> some text </b> some text </i>) there where rules on how to handle this abomination, so every browser shows the same page. This will also result in a more standardised web but it would also keep the web accessible to hobbyists.</p>
